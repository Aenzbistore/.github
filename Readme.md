# Cloud-Based Backend System for Business and Management Software

This project implements a cloud-based backend system for business and management software. It includes several key components such as user authentication and authorization, database management, API gateway, microservices architecture, plugin and extension framework, event-driven architecture, containerization and orchestration, logging and monitoring, integration with third-party services, scalability, high availability, and security measures.

## Features

- **User Authentication and Authorization**: Implements a robust authentication system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and bcrypt for password hashing. Defines user roles and permissions for authorization.
- **Database Management**: Utilizes PostgreSQL for relational database management.
- **API Gateway**: Develops an API gateway using Express.js to manage incoming requests, enforce security policies, and route requests to appropriate services.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Designs the backend using a microservices architecture for modularity, scalability, and flexibility.
- **Plugin and Extension Framework**: Creates a framework for easy integration of plugins and extensions. Defines clear interfaces and standards for plugin development.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Implements an event-driven architecture using EventEmitter.
- **Containerization and Orchestration**: Utilizes Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for container orchestration.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Sets up logging and monitoring solutions using ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
- **Integration with Third-Party Services**: Enables integration with third-party services and APIs for functionalities such as payment processing, email notifications, and analytics.
- **Scalability and High Availability**: Designs the backend system to scale horizontally and deploys it across multiple availability zones for high availability and fault tolerance.
- **Security Measures**: Implements data encryption, API rate limiting, input validation, and regular security audits to protect against common vulnerabilities.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up environment variables:

    - Create a `.env` file based on the provided `.env.example` file.
    - Update the environment variables with your configuration.

4. Start the server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Usage

- **Login**: Send a POST request to `/login` with the username and password in the request body. You will receive a JWT access token upon successful authentication.
- **User Management**: Access the `/users` endpoint to manage users. Requires authentication with an admin role.
